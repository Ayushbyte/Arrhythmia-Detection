## Abstract

In the 21st century, cardiac arrests have emerged as a leading cause of mortality among young adults, with arrhythmia being one of the most overlooked early warning signs. Cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually worldwide, with sudden cardiac death claiming lives at an alarming rate of one person every 36 seconds. This project presents an innovative, cost-effective arrhythmia detection system utilizing the AD8232 ECG sensor module integrated with ESP32 microcontroller and TFT display technology.

Our system addresses critical challenges in current cardiac monitoring: high equipment costs, complex operation procedures, and susceptibility to environmental noise interference. Through implementation of advanced signal processing techniques including the Pan-Tompkins algorithm for QRS complex detection and strategic filtering mechanisms, we have developed a user-friendly portable device capable of real-time arrhythmia classification. The system demonstrates significant noise reduction capabilities through integrated 50Hz notch filtering and achieves reliable detection of bradycardia (<60 BPM), normal sinus rhythm (60-100 BPM), and tachycardia (>100 BPM) conditions.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 QRS Complex Analysis

The QRS complex represents the electrical activity associated with ventricular depolarization in the cardiac cycle. Understanding and accurately detecting QRS complexes forms the foundation of arrhythmia detection systems.

#### 2.1.1 QRS Complex Characteristics

The QRS complex consists of three distinct waves:
- **Q Wave:** Initial negative deflection representing septal depolarization
- **R Wave:** Prominent positive deflection indicating ventricular depolarization
- **S Wave:** Negative deflection following the R wave

**Normal QRS Duration:** 80-120 milliseconds  
**Amplitude Variations:** 5-25 mV depending on lead configuration and patient physiology

#### 2.1.2 Clinical Significance

QRS complex morphology provides critical information about:
- **Heart Rate Calculation:** R-R interval measurement enables precise BPM determination
- **Rhythm Regularity:** Consistent R-R intervals indicate normal sinus rhythm
- **Conduction Abnormalities:** Widened QRS complexes may indicate bundle branch blocks
- **Arrhythmia Classification:** Irregular R-R patterns suggest various arrhythmic conditions

### 2.2 R-R Interval Calculation and Peak Detection

#### 2.2.1 R-Peak Detection Methodology

Our system employs a multi-stage approach for accurate R-peak identification:

1. **Signal Preprocessing:**
   - High-pass filtering (0.5 Hz) to remove baseline wander
   - Low-pass filtering (40 Hz) to eliminate high-frequency noise
   - Notch filtering (50 Hz) to suppress power line interference

2. **Derivative-Based Detection:**
   - First-order derivative calculation to emphasize steep slopes
   - Squaring operation to amplify QRS complexes relative to noise
   - Moving window integration for signal smoothing

3. **Adaptive Thresholding:**
   - Dynamic threshold adjustment based on signal amplitude history
   - Dual-threshold system for improved sensitivity and specificity
   - Refractory period implementation to prevent double detection

#### 2.2.2 R-R Interval Analysis

**Beat-to-Beat Interval Measurement:**
```
R-R Interval = Time(R_peak[n+1]) - Time(R_peak[n])
Heart Rate (BPM) = 60000 / Average(R-R Intervals)
```

**Statistical Analysis:**
- **Mean R-R Interval:** Average interval over analysis window
- **R-R Variability:** Standard deviation of intervals indicating rhythm stability
- **Trend Analysis:** Progressive changes in interval duration
