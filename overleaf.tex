In the 21st century, cardiac arrests have emerged as a leading cause of mortality among young adults, with arrhythmia being one of the most overlooked early warning signs. Cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually worldwide, with sudden cardiac death claiming lives at an alarming rate of one person every 36 seconds. This project presents an innovative, cost-effective arrhythmia detection system utilizing the AD8232 ECG sensor module integrated with ESP32 microcontroller and TFT display technology.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Our system addresses critical challenges in current cardiac monitoring: high equipment costs, complex operation procedures, and susceptibility to environmental noise interference. Through implementation of advanced signal processing techniques including the Pan-Tompkins algorithm for QRS complex detection and strategic filtering mechanisms, we have developed a user-friendly portable device capable of real-time arrhythmia classification. The system demonstrates significant noise reduction capabilities through integrated 50Hz notch filtering and achieves reliable detection of bradycardia ($<$60 BPM), normal sinus rhythm (60-100 BPM), and tachycardia ($>$100 BPM) conditions.

% Introduction
\section{Introduction}

Cardiovascular diseases remain the primary cause of global mortality, with arrhythmias representing a critical subset requiring immediate medical attention. Arrhythmia, characterized by irregular heart rhythms, often serves as a precursor to more severe cardiac events including myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Traditional ECG monitoring systems, while accurate, are typically confined to clinical settings due to their complexity, size, and cost constraints.
The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in younger demographics necessitates the development of accessible, portable monitoring solutions that can provide early detection capabilities outside traditional clinical environments. Current statistics indicate that cardiovascular diseases are responsible for more deaths globally than any other cause, with the majority of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries where access to advanced cardiac monitoring equipment is limited.
\newpage

\section{Methods and Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{QRS Complex Analysis and Physiological Background}

The QRS complex represents the fundamental electrical signature of ventricular depolarization in the cardiac cycle and serves as the primary feature for heart rate calculation and arrhythmia detection. Understanding the physiological and electrical characteristics of QRS complexes forms the theoretical foundation for developing robust detection algorithms.
\\
The cardiac electrical conduction system generates characteristic waveforms that can be detected and analyzed through surface electrodes. The QRS complex, in particular, represents the largest amplitude signal in the normal ECG and occurs with each heartbeat, making it the most reliable feature for automated detection systems.

\subsubsection{QRS Complex Morphological Characteristics}

The QRS complex consists of three distinct deflections, each corresponding to specific physiological events during ventricular activation:

\textbf{Q Wave Analysis:} The Q wave represents the initial negative deflection resulting from septal depolarization. In normal cardiac conduction, the Q wave has specific amplitude and duration characteristics:

\begin{equation*}
Q_{amplitude} < 0.04 \times R_{amplitude}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
Q_{duration} < 0.04 \text{ seconds}
\end{equation*}

\newpage

\textbf{R Wave Characteristics:} The R wave constitutes the prominent positive deflection indicating main ventricular depolarization. R wave amplitude varies significantly based on electrode placement, patient physiology, and cardiac orientation:

\begin{equation*}
R_{amplitude} = 5 \text{ to } 25 \text{ mV (lead-dependent)}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{S Wave Properties:} The S wave appears as the negative deflection following the R wave, completing ventricular depolarization. The S wave amplitude and morphology provide information about conduction abnormalities and ventricular geometry.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Normal QRS Duration and Clinical Significance:}

The total QRS duration serves as a critical parameter for assessing cardiac conduction:

\begin{equation*}
QRS_{normal} = 80 \text{ to } 120 \text{ milliseconds}
\end{equation*}

Prolonged QRS duration ($>$120 ms) may indicate:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bundle branch blocks
\item Ventricular conduction delays
\item Electrolyte imbalances
\item Pharmacological effects
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Clinical Significance and Diagnostic Applications}

QRS complex analysis provides multiple layers of diagnostic information essential for comprehensive cardiac assessment:

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Heart Rate Calculation Foundation:} The QRS complex, specifically the R wave peak, serves as the timing reference for heart rate calculation. Accurate R-R interval measurement enables precise heart rate determination:

\begin{equation*}
Heart\ Rate\ (BPM) = \frac{60}{\text{Average R-R Interval (seconds)}}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Rhythm Regularity Assessment:} Analysis of R-R interval variability provides insight into rhythm regularity and autonomic nervous system function:

\begin{equation*}
RR_{variability} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(RR_{i+1} - RR_i)^2}{n-1}}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Conduction System Evaluation:} QRS morphology analysis enables detection of conduction abnormalities, including bundle branch blocks, fascicular blocks, and pre-excitation syndromes that may predispose patients to arrhythmic events.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Arrhythmia Classification Parameters:} Different arrhythmia types exhibit characteristic QRS patterns that enable automated classification:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Supraventricular arrhythmias:} Typically narrow QRS complexes ($<$120 ms) with normal morphology
\item \textit{Ventricular arrhythmias:} Wide QRS complexes ($>$120 ms) with abnormal \\ morphology
\item \textit{Conduction blocks:} Prolonged QRS duration with specific morphological patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsection{R-R Interval Calculation and Peak Detection Methodology}

R-R interval calculation forms the cornerstone of heart rate determination and rhythm analysis in ECG signal processing. The methodology for accurate R-peak detection and subsequent interval calculation requires sophisticated signal processing techniques that can operate reliably in the presence of noise and artifacts.

\subsubsection{R-Peak Detection Methodology}

Our system employs a comprehensive multi-stage approach for robust R-peak identification that combines proven signal processing techniques with adaptive algorithms:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Stage 1: Signal Preprocessing and Conditioning}

The initial preprocessing stage prepares the raw ECG signal for subsequent analysis by removing artifacts and enhancing QRS complex characteristics:

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textit\textbf{{High-pass Filtering for Baseline Wander Removal:}}
\begin{equation*}
H_{hp}(z) = \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 - 0.995z^{-1}}
\end{equation*}

This first-order high-pass filter with cutoff frequency at 0.5 Hz effectively removes baseline wander caused by respiration, electrode movement, and DC offset while preserving the QRS spectrum.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textit\textbf{{Low-pass Filtering for High-Frequency Noise Reduction:}}
\begin{equation*}
H_{lp}(z) = \frac{(1 + z^{-1})^6}{(1 + 0.2z^{-1})^6}
\end{equation*}

The low-pass filter with 40 Hz cutoff frequency attenuates EMG artifacts, power line harmonics, and other high-frequency interference while maintaining QRS complex fidelity.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textit{Notch Filtering for Power Line Interference:}
\begin{equation*}
H_{notch}(z) = \frac{1 - 2\cos(\omega_0)z^{-1} + z^{-2}}{1 - 2r\cos(\omega_0)z^{-1} + r^2z^{-2}}
\end{equation*}

Where $\omega_0 = 2\pi \times 50/f_s$ and $r = 0.95$ for 50 Hz notch filtering.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Stage 2: Derivative-Based Enhancement}

The derivative operation emphasizes the steep slopes characteristic of QRS complexes while suppressing slower variations:

\begin{equation*}
y[n] = \frac{1}{8}(-x[n-2] - 2x[n-1] + 2x[n+1] + x[n+2])
\end{equation*}

This five-point derivative approximation provides optimal balance between slope enhancement and noise sensitivity.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Stage 3: Squaring Operation}

The squaring function amplifies large derivatives (QRS complexes) while suppressing smaller variations:

\begin{equation*}
y[n] = (x[n])^2
\end{equation*}

This nonlinear operation significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio for QRS detection.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Stage 4: Moving Window Integration}

Moving window integration smooths the signal and creates a feature waveform suitable for threshold detection:

\begin{equation*}
y[n] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}x[n-i]
\end{equation*}

Where N is typically chosen as the approximate QRS width in samples (80-120 ms equivalent).

\newpage

\subsubsection{Adaptive Thresholding Algorithm}

The adaptive thresholding system automatically adjusts detection sensitivity based on signal characteristics and noise levels:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Dual Threshold System:}

\begin{equation*}
Threshold_1 = 0.625 \times Peak_I + 0.375 \times SPK_I
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
Threshold_2 = 0.5 \times Threshold_1
\end{equation*}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $SPK_I$ = Running estimate of signal peak amplitude
\item $Peak_I$ = Peak amplitude of current analysis window
\item $Threshold_1$ = Primary detection threshold
\item $Threshold_2$ = Secondary threshold for missed beat recovery
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Learning Phase Implementation:}

The system implements an initial learning phase to establish baseline signal characteristics:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{- Adaptive Threshold Learning Algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Initialize: $SPKI = 0$, $NPKI = 0$, $PEAK_I = 0$
\FOR{$i = 1$ to $LEARNING\_SAMPLES$}
    \STATE Process ECG sample through filter chain
    \IF{Peak detected above noise floor}
        \STATE Update $SPKI = 0.125 \times PEAK + 0.875 \times SPKI$
    \ELSE
        \STATE Update $NPKI = 0.125 \times PEAK + 0.875 \times NPKI$
    \ENDIF
    \STATE Calculate adaptive thresholds
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{R-R Interval Analysis and Statistical Processing}

Once R-peaks are accurately detected, the system calculates R-R intervals and performs statistical analysis for heart rate determination and rhythm assessment:

\newpage

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Beat-to-Beat Interval Measurement:}

\begin{equation*}
RR_i = t_{R(i+1)} - t_{R(i)}
\end{equation*}

Where $t_{R(i)}$ represents the time of the i-th R-peak occurrence.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Heart Rate Calculation:}

\begin{equation*}
HR = \frac{60000}{\overline{RR}} \text{ (BPM)}
\end{equation*}

Where $\overline{RR}$ is the average R-R interval in milliseconds over a specified analysis window.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Statistical Rhythm Analysis:}

\textit{R-R Interval Variability:}
\begin{equation*}
RMSSD = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}(RR_{i+1} - RR_i)^2}
\end{equation*}

\textit{Rhythm Regularity Index:}
\begin{equation*}
Regularity = \frac{\sigma_{RR}}{\overline{RR}} \times 100\%
\end{equation*}

Where $\sigma_{RR}$ is the standard deviation of R-R intervals.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Trend Analysis Implementation:}

The system implements trend analysis to detect progressive changes in heart rate that may indicate developing arrhythmic conditions:

\begin{equation*}
Trend_{slope} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(i - \bar{i})(HR_i - \overline{HR})}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(i - \bar{i})^2}
\end{equation*}

This linear regression approach identifies gradual heart rate changes that may precede arrhythmic episodes.

\subsection{Pan-Tompkins Algorithm Implementation}

The Pan-Tompkins algorithm represents the gold standard for QRS complex detection in ECG signal processing, providing robust performance across diverse patient populations, signal qualities, and noise conditions. This algorithm has been extensively validated in clinical settings and forms the backbone of many commercial ECG analysis systems.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Our implementation of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm is optimized for real-time operation on the ESP32 microcontroller platform while maintaining the algorithm's proven detection accuracy and noise immunity characteristics.

\subsubsection{Algorithm Architecture and Mathematical Foundation}

The Pan-Tompkins algorithm employs a carefully designed sequence of signal processing operations that progressively enhance QRS complex detectability while suppressing noise and artifacts:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Stage 1: Bandpass Filtering Implementation}

The bandpass filtering stage combines low-pass and high-pass filtering operations to isolate the QRS frequency spectrum (5-15 Hz) where most QRS energy is concentrated:

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{\textit{Low-pass Filter Design:}}
The low-pass filter attenuates high-frequency noise while preserving QRS morphology:

\begin{equation*}
H_{LP}(z) = \frac{(1-z^{-6})^2}{(1-z^{-1})^2}
\end{equation*}

This filter provides a cutoff frequency of approximately 11 Hz when implemented at 200 Hz sampling rate. The filter's transfer function can be expanded as:

\begin{equation*}
H_{LP}(z) = \frac{1 - 2z^{-6} + z^{-12}}{1 - 2z^{-1} + z^{-2}}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{\textit{High-pass Filter Design:}}
The high-pass filter removes baseline wander and low-frequency artifacts:

\begin{equation*}
H_{HP}(z) = \frac{-\frac{1}{32} + z^{-16} - z^{-17} + \frac{1}{32}z^{-32}}{1 - z^{-1}}
\end{equation*}

This filter provides a cutoff frequency of approximately 5 Hz, effectively removing respiratory artifacts and electrode motion artifacts while preserving QRS complex characteristics.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Stage 2: Derivative Filter Implementation}

The derivative filter enhances the slope information of QRS complexes, making them more easily distinguishable from other ECG components:

\begin{equation*}
H_{deriv}(z) = \frac{1}{8}(-z^{-2} - 2z^{-1} + 2z^{1} + z^{2})
\end{equation*}

This five-point derivative approximation provides an optimal balance between slope enhancement and noise sensitivity. The derivative operation emphasizes rapid changes characteristic of QRS complexes while suppressing the slower changes associated with P and T waves.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Implementation in Time Domain:}
\begin{equation*}
y[n] = \frac{1}{8}(-x[n-2] - 2x[n-1] + 2x[n+1] + x[n+2])
\end{equation*}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Stage 3: Squaring Function}

The squaring operation serves multiple purposes in the QRS detection process:

\begin{equation*}
y[n] = (x[n])^2
\end{equation*}

\textit{Benefits of Squaring:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Amplifies large derivative values (QRS complexes) relative to smaller values
\item Makes all values positive, simplifying subsequent processing
\item Enhances signal-to-noise ratio for detection
\item Suppresses low-amplitude noise and artifacts
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Stage 4: Moving Window Integration}

The moving window integration smooths the signal and creates a feature waveform suitable for threshold-based detection:

\begin{equation*}
y[n] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}x[n-i]
\end{equation*}

\textbf{\textit{Window Size Optimization:}}
The integration window width N is critical for optimal performance:

\begin{equation*}
N = \frac{0.15 \times f_s}{1} \text{ samples}
\end{equation*}

Where $f_s$ is the sampling frequency. For a 500 Hz sampling rate, N $\approx$ 75 samples, corresponding to approximately 150 ms.

\subsubsection{Decision Logic and Adaptive Thresholding}

The decision logic component implements sophisticated threshold adaptation and beat validation mechanisms:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Adaptive Threshold Calculation:}

The algorithm maintains two sets of thresholds for different signal conditions:

\begin{equation*}
THRESHOLD_{I1} = 0.625 \times PEAK_I + 0.375 \times SPKI
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
THRESHOLD_{I2} = 0.5 \times THRESHOLD_{I1}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
THRESHOLD_{F1} = 0.625 \times PEAK_F + 0.375 \times SPKF
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
THRESHOLD_{F2} = 0.5 \times THRESHOLD_{F1}
\end{equation*}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $SPKI$ = Running estimate of signal peak amplitude (integration waveform)
\item $SPKF$ = Running estimate of signal peak amplitude (filtered signal)
\item $PEAK_I$ = Current peak amplitude (integration waveform)
\item $PEAK_F$ = Current peak amplitude (filtered signal)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Peak Update Equations:}

Signal peaks are updated using exponential averaging:

\begin{equation*}
SPKI = 0.125 \times PEAK_I + 0.875 \times SPKI
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
SPKF = 0.125 \times PEAK_F + 0.875 \times SPKF
\end{equation*}

Noise peaks are similarly updated:

\begin{equation*}
NPKI = 0.125 \times PEAK_I + 0.875 \times NPKI
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
NPKF = 0.125 \times PEAK_F + 0.875 \times NPKF
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Real-time Implementation Optimization}

The Pan-Tompkins algorithm implementation for the ESP32 platform incorporates \\ several optimization strategies for real-time performance:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Computational Efficiency Enhancements:}

\textbf{\textit{Fixed-Point Arithmetic:}}
To optimize processing speed on the ESP32, floating-point operations are replaced with fixed-point arithmetic where possible:

\begin{equation*}
y[n] = \frac{(x[n] \times 32768)^2}{32768}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{\textit{Circular Buffer Implementation:}}
Memory usage is optimized through circular buffer implementation for filter delay lines:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Circular Buffer Management}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Initialize: $buffer[N]$, $index = 0$
\PROCEDURE{UpdateBuffer}{$newSample$}
    \STATE $buffer[index] = newSample$
    \STATE $index = (index + 1) \mod N$
    \RETURN $buffer$
\ENDPROCEDURE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\newpage

\textbf{Memory Management Strategy:}

The implementation uses efficient memory allocation to minimize RAM usage:
\begin{itemize}
\item Filter buffers: 400 bytes (maximum delay line length)
\item Peak detection arrays: 200 bytes (running averages)
\item Threshold variables: 32 bytes (adaptive parameters)
\item Total RAM usage: $<$1KB for complete algorithm
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Latency Minimization Techniques:}

\textit{Pipeline Processing:}
The algorithm stages are implemented as a pipeline to minimize processing latency:

\begin{equation*}
Latency_{total} = \max(L_{filter}, L_{derivative}, L_{square}, L_{integrate}) + L_{decision}
\end{equation*}

Where each $L_i$ represents the processing time for stage i.

\textbf{\textit{Interrupt-Driven Sampling:}}
ADC sampling is implemented using timer interrupts to ensure consistent sampling intervals:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Interrupt-Driven ECG Sampling}
\begin{algorithmic}
\PROCEDURE{TimerInterrupt}{}
    \STATE $sample = ADC\_Read()$
    \STATE $ProcessSample(sample)$
    \STATE $UpdateDisplay()$ if needed
\ENDPROCEDURE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\section{System Architecture and Hardware Integration}

\subsection{Hardware Configuration and Component Integration}

The hardware architecture of our arrhythmia detection system represents a carefully orchestrated integration of analog front-end processing, digital signal processing, and user interface components. The system design prioritizes signal integrity, processing efficiency, and user accessibility while maintaining cost-effectiveness and portability.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The overall system architecture follows a modular approach where each component is optimized for its specific function while maintaining seamless integration with other system elements. This design philosophy enables future upgrades and modifications while ensuring robust operation under diverse environmental conditions.

\subsubsection{Sensor Interface Design and Analog Front-End}

The AD8232 ECG module serves as the critical analog front-end component, responsible for acquiring, amplifying, and conditioning the cardiac electrical signals before digital processing. The sensor interface design incorporates several key considerations for optimal signal quality and noise immunity.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{AD8232 ECG Module Detailed Configuration:}

The AD8232 integrates multiple analog processing functions essential for high-quality ECG acquisition:

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textit{Instrumentation Amplifier Characteristics:}
\begin{equation*}
A_{instrumentation} = 1 + \frac{2R_G}{R_{gain}}
\end{equation*}

Where $R_G$ is the external gain-setting resistor. For our application, the gain is configured at 1100 V/V to provide adequate amplification for the typical 1-5 mV ECG signal amplitude.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textit{Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR):}
The AD8232 provides excellent CMRR performance:
\begin{equation*}
CMRR = 20 \log_{10}\left(\frac{A_{differential}}{A_{common-mode}}\right) > 80 \text{ dB}
\end{equation*}

This high CMRR effectively suppresses common-mode interference from power lines and electromagnetic sources.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textit{Integrated Filtering Characteristics:}
The AD8232 incorporates built-in analog filters:
\begin{itemize}
\item High-pass filter: $f_c = 0.5$ Hz (baseline wander removal)
\item Low-pass filter: $f_c = 40$ Hz (anti-aliasing and EMG suppression)
\item Notch filter capability: Configurable for 50/60 Hz rejection
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Electrode Interface and Lead Configuration:}

Our system implements a modified Lead I configuration optimized for portable \\ monitoring:

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textit{Electrode Placement Strategy:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RA (Right Arm):} Placed on right wrist or right upper chest
\item \textbf{LA (Left Arm):} Placed on left wrist or left upper chest  
\item \textbf{RL (Right Leg):} Reference electrode placed on right/left calf or thigh
\end{itemize}

\textit{Lead-Off Detection Implementation:}
The AD8232 provides automatic lead-off detection through dedicated pins:
\begin{equation*}
V_{lead-off} = V_{supply} \times \frac{R_{electrode}}{R_{electrode} + R_{pullup}}

\section{Noise Reduction and Signal Processing Enhancement}

\subsection{Sensor Sensitivity Analysis and Environmental Challenges}

The AD8232 ECG sensor, while highly sensitive to cardiac electrical activity, presents unique challenges when deployed in uncontrolled environments outside traditional clinical settings. Understanding and addressing these sensitivity challenges forms a critical component of developing a robust portable arrhythmia detection system.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The sensitivity of the AD8232 sensor, while beneficial for detecting low-amplitude cardiac signals, makes the system susceptible to various forms of environmental and physiological interference that can significantly impact signal quality and detection accuracy.

\subsubsection{Environmental Interference Source Analysis}

Environmental interference sources can be categorized into several distinct classes, each requiring specific mitigation strategies:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Sources:}

\textit{Power Line Interference Characteristics:}
Power line interference represents the most significant and consistent source of environmental noise in ECG systems:

\begin{equation*}
V_{power\_line} = A_{50Hz} \sin(2\pi \times 50t + \phi) + \sum_{n=3,5,7...}^{\infty} A_{nH} \sin(2\pi \times n \times 50t + \phi_n)
\end{equation*}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A_{50Hz}$ = Fundamental frequency amplitude (typically 1-10 mV)
\item $A_{nH}$ = Harmonic amplitude (decreasing with frequency)
\item $\phi, \phi_n$ = Phase angles dependent on proximity to power sources
\end{itemize}

\textit{Switching Power Supply Interference:}
Modern electronic devices generate high-frequency switching noise that can couple into ECG acquisition systems:

\begin{equation*}
f_{switching} = 20 \text{ kHz to } 2 \text{ MHz}
\end{equation*}

Although outside the primary ECG bandwidth, switching frequencies can create aliasing effects and intermodulation distortion.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textit{Radio Frequency Interference (RFI):}
Wireless communication systems operating in various frequency bands can introduce interference through several mechanisms:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cellular networks:} 800 MHz - 2.6 GHz bands
\item \textbf{Wi-Fi systems:} 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands  
\item \textbf{Bluetooth devices:} 2.4 GHz band
\item \textbf{Emergency services:} VHF/UHF bands
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Physiological Artifact Sources:}

\textit{Electromyographic (EMG) Interference:}
Skeletal muscle contractions generate electrical activity that overlaps with ECG frequency spectrum:

\begin{equation*}
f_{EMG} = 20 \text{ Hz to } 500 \text{ Hz}
\end{equation*}

EMG amplitude can range from 50 μV to 5 mV, potentially exceeding ECG signal amplitude during muscle contraction.

\textit{Motion Artifact Characteristics:}
Electrode movement and skin stretching create low-frequency artifacts:

\begin{equation*}
f_{motion} = 0.1 \text{ Hz to } 10 \text{ Hz}
\end{equation*}

Motion artifacts can cause baseline shifts exceeding ±10 mV, overwhelming ECG signals and triggering false detection events.

\subsubsection{Signal-to-Noise Ratio Analysis and Optimization}

Quantitative analysis of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) provides the foundation for developing effective noise reduction strategies:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{ECG Signal Characteristics:}

Typical ECG signal parameters in portable monitoring applications:

\begin{equation*}
A_{ECG} = 0.5 \text{ to } 4 \text{ mV (peak-to-peak)}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
f_{ECG} = 0.05 \text{ to } 100 \text{ Hz (full spectrum)}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
f_{QRS} = 5 \text{ to } 15 \text{ Hz (primary energy)}
\end{equation*}

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Noise Floor Analysis:}

Environmental noise characteristics in different settings:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Environmental Noise Analysis}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Environment} & \textbf{Noise Floor} & \textbf{Primary Sources} & \textbf{SNR} \\
\hline
Clinical Laboratory & 10-20 $\mu$V RMS & Fluorescent lighting & $>$30 dB \\
Office Environment & 50-100 $\mu$V RMS & Computers, monitors & 20-26 dB \\
Home Setting & 100-200 $\mu$V RMS & Appliances, lighting & 14-20 dB \\
Industrial Environment & 500-1000 $\mu$V RMS & Motors, machinery & 6-12 dB \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{SNR Optimization Strategies:}

\textit{Required SNR for Reliable Detection:}
\begin{equation*}
SNR_{required} = 20 \log_{10}\left(\frac{A_{signal}}{A_{noise}}\right) > 15 \text{ dB}
\end{equation*}

This threshold ensures reliable QRS detection with false positive rates <5%.

\textit{Amplification Strategy:}
\begin{equation*}
A_{total} = A_{instrumentation} \times A_{programmable} = 1100 \times A_{digital}
\end{equation*}

Where digital amplification $A_{digital}$ can be adjusted based on signal strength assessment.

\subsection{Digital Filtering Implementation and Optimization}

Digital filtering forms the cornerstone of noise reduction in our arrhythmia detection system. The filtering strategy employs multiple complementary approaches to address different noise sources while preserving ECG signal integrity.

\subsubsection{50 Hz Notch Filter Design and Implementation}

Power line interference at 50 Hz (or 60 Hz in some regions) represents a persistent and predictable interference source that requires targeted elimination:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Second-Order IIR Notch Filter Design:}

The notch filter is designed to provide sharp attenuation at the power line frequency while minimizing impact on nearby frequencies:

\begin{equation*}
H_{notch}(z) = \frac{b_0 + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2}}{1 + a_1 z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2}}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Filter Coefficient Calculation:}

For a notch filter centered at frequency $f_0$ with sampling frequency $f_s$ and quality factor $Q$:

\begin{equation*}
\omega_0 = \frac{2\pi f_0}{f_s}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
\alpha = \frac{\sin(\omega_0)}{2Q}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Coefficient Values:}
\begin{align*}
b_0 &= 1\\
b_1 &= -2\cos(\omega_0)\\
b_2 &= 1\\
a_1 &= -2\cos(\omega_0)(1-\alpha)\\
a_2 &= 1-2\alpha
\end{align*}

For $f_0 = 50$ Hz, $f_s = 500$ Hz, and $Q = 25$:

\begin{align*}
\omega_0 &= \frac{2\pi \times 50}{500} = 0.628 \text{ radians}\\
\alpha &= \frac{\sin(0.628)}{2 \times 25} = 0.0118
\end{align*}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Filter Performance Characteristics:}

\textit{Frequency Response Analysis:}
\begin{equation*}
|H_{notch}(\omega)|^2 = \frac{|b_0 + b_1 e^{-j\omega} + b_2 e^{-j2\omega}|^2}{|1 + a_1 e^{-j\omega} + a_2 e^{-j2\omega}|^2}
\end{equation*}

At the notch frequency ($\omega = \omega_0$):
\begin{equation*}
|H_{notch}(\omega_0)| = \frac{|1 - 2\cos(\omega_0) + 1|}{|1 - 2\cos(\omega_0)(1-\alpha) + (1-2\alpha)|} \approx 0.01 \text{ (-40 dB)}
\end{equation*}

\textit{Phase Response Characteristics:}
The notch filter introduces minimal phase distortion away from the notch frequency:
\begin{equation*}
\angle H_{notch}(\omega) = \arctan\left(\frac{\text{Im}[H_{notch}(\omega)]}{\text{Re}[H_{notch}(\omega)]}\right)
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Cascaded Filter Architecture for Comprehensive Noise Reduction}

A multi-stage filtering approach addresses different noise sources with optimized filter designs for each interference type:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Stage 1: High-Pass Filter for Baseline Wander Removal}

Baseline wander caused by respiration, electrode movement, and DC offset requires removal while preserving low-frequency ECG components:

\textit{First-Order Butterworth High-Pass Filter:}
\begin{equation*}
H_{hp}(s) = \frac{s}{s + \omega_c}
\end{equation*}

\textit{Bilinear Transform for Digital Implementation:}
\begin{equation*}
s = \frac{2}{T}\frac{1-z^{-1}}{1+z^{-1}}
\end{equation*}

Where $T = 1/f_s$ is the sampling period.

\textit{Digital Filter Transfer Function:}
\begin{equation*}
H_{hp}(z) = \frac{1-z^{-1}}{1-\beta z^{-1}}
\end{equation*}

Where:
\begin{equation*}
\beta = \frac{1-\omega_c T/2}{1+\omega_c T/2}
\end{equation*}

For $f_c = 0.5$ Hz and $f_s = 500$ Hz:
\begin{equation*}
\beta = \frac{1-\pi \times 0.5/500}{1+\pi \times 0.5/500} = 0.9969
\end{equation*}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Stage 2: Low-Pass Filter for High-Frequency Noise Reduction}

High-frequency noise from EMG artifacts and electromagnetic interference requires attenuation while preserving QRS complex morphology:

\textit{Fourth-Order Butterworth Low-Pass Filter:}
\begin{equation*}
H_{lp}(s) = \frac{\omega_c^4}{(s^2 + \sqrt{2}\omega_c s + \omega_c^2)(s^2 + \sqrt{2}\omega_c s + \omega_c^2)}
\end{equation*}

\textit{Cascaded Biquad Implementation:}
\begin{equation*}
H_{lp}(z) = H_1(z) \times H_2(z)
\end{equation*}

Where each biquad section $H_i(z)$ implements a second-order Butterworth response.

For $f_c = 40$ Hz:
\begin{equation*}
H_1(z) = H_2(z) = \frac{b_0 + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2}}{1 + a_1 z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2}}
\end{equation*}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Stage 3: Adaptive Notch Filter for Power Line Interference}

The notch filter implementation includes adaptive capabilities to handle frequency variations in power line interference:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Adaptive Notch Filter Implementation}
\begin{algorithmic}
\PROCEDURE{AdaptiveNotchFilter}{$input$, $frequency$}
    \STATE Calculate filter coefficients for current frequency
    \STATE Apply notch filter to input signal
    \STATE Estimate residual power line interference
    \IF{interference level > threshold}
        \STATE Adjust Q factor for deeper notch
    \ELSE
        \STATE Reduce Q factor to minimize signal distortion
    \ENDIF
    \RETURN filtered signal
\ENDPROCEDURE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\newpage
\subsubsection{Advanced Noise Reduction Techniques}

Beyond traditional filtering approaches, our system implements sophisticated noise reduction strategies tailored for portable ECG monitoring:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Adaptive Filtering and Noise Estimation:}

\textit{Least Mean Squares (LMS) Adaptive Filter:}
The LMS algorithm adapts filter coefficients based on estimated noise characteristics:

\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{w}(n+1) = \mathbf{w}(n) + \mu \mathbf{x}(n) e(n)
\end{equation*}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathbf{w}(n)$ = Filter coefficient vector at time n
\item $\mu$ = Adaptation step size (0.001 to 0.01)
\item $\mathbf{x}(n)$ = Input signal vector
\item $e(n)$ = Error signal (desired - actual output)
\end{itemize}

\textit{Noise Level Estimation Algorithm:}
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{noise}^2(n) = \alpha \sigma_{noise}^2(n-1) + (1-\alpha)|x(n) - \hat{x}(n)|^2
\end{equation*}

Where $\hat{x}(n)$ is the predicted signal value and $\alpha = 0.99$ provides exponential averaging.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Statistical Signal Enhancement:}

\textit{Ensemble Averaging for Periodic Noise Reduction:}
For signals with known periodicity, ensemble averaging effectively reduces random noise:

\begin{equation*}
\bar{x}(n) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^{K} x(n + kT)
\end{equation*}

Where K is the number of averaged epochs and T is the signal period.

\textit{Median Filtering for Impulse Noise Removal:}
Median filtering preserves QRS sharp edges while removing impulse artifacts:

\begin{equation*}
y(n) = \text{median}\{x(n-M), x(n-M+1), ..., x(n), ..., x(n+M)\}
\end{equation*}

Where the window size (2M+1) is typically 3-5 samples for ECG applications.

\end{table}

\subsection{Accuracy Limitations and Contributing Factors}

Our comparative analysis reveals several key observations regarding the accuracy limitations of our current system:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{1. Detection Accuracy Challenges:}

The 87.3\% overall accuracy of our system, while reasonable for a cost-effective solution, falls short of machine learning-based approaches that achieve 94-97\% accuracy. This gap can be attributed to several factors:

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textit{Single-Lead Limitation:} Our system relies on a single-lead ECG configuration, which provides limited spatial information compared to multi-lead systems. Machine learning approaches often utilize 12-lead ECG data, providing comprehensive cardiac electrical activity visualization.

\textit{Rule-Based Classification:} The current implementation uses threshold-based classification (bradycardia <60 BPM, tachycardia >100 BPM), which lacks the sophistication of pattern recognition algorithms that can identify subtle morphological changes characteristic of specific arrhythmia types.

\textit{Noise Sensitivity:} Despite comprehensive filtering, environmental noise and motion artifacts continue to impact detection accuracy, particularly in non-clinical settings where our system is intended for deployment.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{2. Sensitivity and Specificity Analysis:}

\textit{Sensitivity Limitations (89.1\%):} The system occasionally misses arrhythmic events, particularly:
\begin{itemize}
\item Low-amplitude premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)
\item Atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates within normal range
\item Subtle morphological changes in early-stage arrhythmias
\end{itemize}

\textit{Specificity Challenges (85.7\%):} False positive detections occur primarily due to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Motion artifacts mimicking arrhythmic patterns
\item Electromagnetic interference creating artificial rhythm irregularities
\item Electrode placement variations affecting signal morphology
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{3. Comparative Advantages Despite Accuracy Limitations:}

While our system demonstrates lower accuracy compared to advanced ML approaches, it offers significant advantages in specific deployment scenarios:

\textit{Cost-Effectiveness:} At ₹3,500, our system costs 91.2\% less than traditional clinical equipment and 86.7\% less than CNN-based systems, making it accessible for widespread screening applications.

\textit{Power Efficiency:} The ESP32-based implementation consumes <200mW during operation, enabling 24-48 hours of continuous monitoring on battery power, compared to 2-4 hours for ML-based portable systems.

\textit{Real-Time Processing:} Unlike cloud-dependent ML systems, our implementation provides immediate results without requiring internet connectivity or cloud processing infrastructure.

\subsection{Sources of Accuracy Degradation}

Detailed analysis of our system's performance reveals specific sources of accuracy degradation that could be addressed in future iterations:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{1. Signal Quality Issues:}

\textit{Electrode Contact Quality:} Inconsistent electrode-skin contact resistance (varying from 1kΩ to 50kΩ) introduces signal amplitude variations that affect threshold-based detection algorithms.

\textit{Motion Artifacts:} Patient movement creates baseline shifts exceeding ±5mV, which can overwhelm ECG signals (typically 0.5-4mV) and trigger false detections.

\vspace{0.3cm}
